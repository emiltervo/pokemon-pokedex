# Pokémon Pokédex

A simple Pokémon Pokédex built with Next.js and React, featuring the first 151 Pokémon from the original series.

The app also includes search functionality and type-based filtering.

## Features

- Display a grid of 151 Pokémon from the first generation.
- View individual Pokémon details on a dedicated page.
- Search Pokémon by name.
- Filter Pokémon by type.
- Data is cached in `localStorage` to minimize API requests and improve performance.
- Pokéball favicon for that classic Pokémon feel.
